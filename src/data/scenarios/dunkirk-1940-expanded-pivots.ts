Public debates about defence could have focused on whether professional skills survive sudden defeats, rather than assuming that new recruits can quickly replace an experienced army.",

More soldiers could have waited exposed to attack while boats made repeated journeys, even where the perimeter still held.",

The two armies depended on the same shrinking route out, while French troops helped sustain the perimeter. Decisions about embarkation could have affected trust between allies as well as the number of trained soldiers reaching Britain.",

New supplies would have needed trained crews and officers. Material recovery and military training could have proceeded at different speeds, limiting how quickly restored formations could take on demanding operations.",
